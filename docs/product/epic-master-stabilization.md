# Portfolio as a Service - Master Stabilization Epic

## Epic Title
**EPIC-001**: Portfolio as a Service - Production Readiness and Stabilization

## Epic Goal
Transform the existing Portfolio as a Service platform from its current unstable state into a production-ready system with complete testing, documentation, and operational excellence, ensuring reliability and maintainability for future development.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current Functionality:**
- Rails 8.0.1 API backend serving portfolio data
- Next.js frontend consuming REST APIs
- Basic portfolio creation and viewing capabilities
- Partially implemented Rodauth authentication
- Twilio SMS integration (sandbox)

**Technology Stack:**
- Backend: Rails 8.0.1, SQLite/PostgreSQL, Rodauth, Solid Queue/Cache
- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kamal (untested), GitHub Actions (broken)
- Testing: RSpec (broken/incomplete), Jest (not configured)

**Current State Issues:**
- CI/CD pipeline broken or misconfigured
- Tests missing or failing across all levels
- Authentication incomplete and untested
- Documentation scattered across 120+ files
- No clear project management structure
- Significant technical debt

### Enhancement Details

**What's Being Stabilized:**
1. Complete documentation consolidation and standardization
2. Full test suite implementation and CI/CD repair
3. Authentication system completion with Rodauth
4. Code standardization and architectural patterns
5. Production deployment readiness

**Integration Approach:**
- Preserve all existing functionality while refactoring
- Incremental improvements with continuous validation
- Non-breaking changes with backward compatibility
- Phased rollout with feature flags where needed

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% CI/CD pipeline success rate
- >80% test coverage on critical paths
- Complete authentication flow working E2E
- All documentation consolidated in /docs
- System deployable to production with single command
- <500ms API response times

## Sub-Epics Structure

Given the scope and complexity, this master epic is broken down into 5 sub-epics:

### SUB-EPIC-001: Documentation Consolidation and Standardization
**Goal:** Unify all documentation into coherent, accessible structure
**Duration:** 1 week
**Priority:** P0 - Critical (Foundation for all other work)

### SUB-EPIC-002: Testing Infrastructure and CI/CD Pipeline
**Goal:** Establish reliable testing and deployment pipeline
**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Priority:** P0 - Critical

### SUB-EPIC-003: Authentication System Completion
**Goal:** Fully implement and test Rodauth authentication
**Duration:** 1 week
**Priority:** P0 - Critical

### SUB-EPIC-004: Code Standardization and Technical Debt
**Goal:** Apply consistent patterns and resolve technical debt
**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Priority:** P1 - High

### SUB-EPIC-005: Production Deployment Preparation
**Goal:** Configure and validate production environment
**Duration:** 1 week
**Priority:** P0 - Critical

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ All existing API endpoints must maintain backward compatibility
- ✅ Database migrations must be non-destructive and reversible
- ✅ Frontend must continue working throughout changes
- ✅ Performance must not degrade (<500ms response times)
- ✅ Data integrity must be preserved
- ✅ Existing user sessions must not be invalidated

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Primary Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Breaking existing functionality | Medium | High | Comprehensive testing before each change, feature flags |
| Data loss during migration | Low | Critical | Full backups, staged migrations, rollback procedures |
| Extended timeline | Medium | Medium | Weekly progress reviews, scope adjustment capability |
| Authentication breaking users | Low | High | Phased rollout, parallel auth systems temporarily |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Performance testing, monitoring, optimization sprints |

### Rollback Plan
1. Git tags at each major milestone
2. Database backup before each migration
3. Feature flags for new functionality
4. Blue-green deployment capability
5. Documented rollback procedures for each phase

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- PostgreSQL 14+ availability for production
- GitHub Actions minutes for CI/CD
- Docker/Kamal configuration validity
- Twilio account for SMS functionality

### Knowledge Dependencies
- Rails 8.0.1 best practices
- Next.js integration patterns
- Rodauth configuration expertise
- DevOps and deployment knowledge
