### Production
- **Trigger**: Git tags (v*)
- **Environment**: portfolio.example.com
- **Deployment**: Blue-green with validation
- **Rollback**: Automatic on failure
- **Validation**: Smoke tests required

## 📊 Safety Features

1. **Test Gate**: Production requires passing tests
2. **Backup**: Automatic before production deploy
3. **Health Checks**: Multiple retry attempts
4. **Smoke Tests**: Newman/Postman validation
5. **Rollback**: Automatic on any failure
6. **Notifications**: Team alerted on all events
