**Parent**: SUB-EPIC-002 - Testing Infrastructure and CI/CD Pipeline  
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS  
**Assignee**: Backend Developer  
**Branch**: `feature/story-002-backend-tests`  
**Estimation**: 16 hours  
**Time Spent**: 4 hours  
**Progress**: 25%

## 📋 Story Details

**As a** technical lead  
**I want to** have comprehensive backend test coverage  
**So that** the API is reliable and maintainable

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Model specs for all domain models (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Controller specs for all API endpoints (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Service specs for business logic (>85% coverage)
- [ ] Request specs for integration testing
- [ ] Validation and edge case testing
- [ ] Authentication flow fully tested

## 📊 Current Progress

### Coverage Metrics
| Component | Target | Current | Status |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Models | >90% | ~15% | 🔴 |
| Controllers | >80% | ~5% | 🔴 |
| Services | >85% | ~10% | 🔴 |
| Requests | Full | ~25% | 🔴 |
| **Overall** | **>80%** | **~5%** | 🔴 CRITICAL |

### Test Statistics
- **Total Examples**: 31
- **Passing**: 13 (42%)
- **Failing**: 18 (58%)
- **Pending**: 0

## 📝 Tasks

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Fix RSpec configuration in rails_helper.rb
- [x] Create initial model specs structure
- [x] Write Blog::Article spec
- [x] Write IAM::User spec
- [x] Create authentication service spec
- [x] Create health check request spec

### 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] Fix 18 failing tests to match actual models
- [ ] Create proper factories for all models

### ⏳ Pending
- [ ] Write controller specs for API v1 endpoints
- [ ] Complete service specs for business logic
- [ ] Create request specs for full API flow
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Test Rodauth authentication flows
- [ ] Achieve >80% overall coverage

## 🔍 Technical Findings

### Issues Discovered
1. **Model Structure Mismatch**
   - IAM models use different structure than expected
   - Polymorphic associations in IAM::User
   - Blog::Article has different validations

2. **Factory Configuration**
   - Need factories matching actual model structure
   - Duplicate factory definitions causing conflicts

3. **Rodauth Integration**
   - Special handling required for authentication
   - Account management through Rodauth

## 📈 Implementation Log

### Session 1 (2025-01-20) - 2 hours
- Created RSpec configuration
- Added test gems to Gemfile
- Created initial test files
- Discovered model structure differences
- Achieved 15% baseline coverage

### Session 2 (2025-08-25) - 2 hours  
- Created rapid test coverage improvement script
- Fixed ApiController dependency issue  
- Added comprehensive model test files
- Identified duplicate factory issues
- Current coverage: ~5% (critical)

### Next Session Plan (URGENT - Today)
1. Fix factory duplicates and frozen array issues
2. Run comprehensive test suite successfully
3. Add 25% more coverage TODAY to reach 30%
4. Pair programming session at 4 PM coverage review

## 🎯 Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] >80% test coverage achieved
- [ ] All tests passing (0 failures)
- [ ] Coverage report generated
- [ ] CI pipeline validates tests
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

## 📊 Risk & Blockers

| Issue | Impact | Status | Resolution |
|-------|--------|--------|------------|
| Model structure different | High | Active | Adjusting tests to match |
| Rodauth complexity | Medium | Identified | Need to study integration |
| Time constraint | Medium | Monitoring | May need 20h vs 16h |

## 📝 Notes

- Actual models have different structure than initially documented
- Need to understand Rodauth integration better
- Consider pair programming with QA for test patterns
