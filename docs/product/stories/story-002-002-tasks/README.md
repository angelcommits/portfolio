## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Backend Developer

1. **Start with TASK-001**: Fix the 18 failing tests
   ```bash
   cd portfolio-backend
   bundle exec rspec --fail-fast
   ```

2. **Then TASK-002**: Complete model tests
   ```bash
   bundle exec rspec spec/models/
   ```

3. **Continue sequentially** through remaining tasks

### Current Blocker

⚠️ **TASK-001 is blocking all other tasks** - 18 tests are failing due to model structure mismatches.

## 📈 Coverage Progress

```
Current Coverage: 15%
├── Models:       15% → Target: 90%
├── Controllers:  18% → Target: 85%
├── Services:      0% → Target: 80%
├── Jobs:          0% → Target: 70%
└── Helpers:       0% → Target: 60%

Overall Target: 80%
Gap to Close: 65%
```

## 🔄 Parallel Work Opportunities

Once TASK-001 is complete:
- **TASK-002** and **TASK-003** can be worked in parallel by different developers
- **TASK-004** can start once either 002 or 003 is complete
- **TASK-005** requires 002, 003, and 004 to be mostly complete

## 📊 Success Metrics

- [ ] All 18 failing tests fixed
- [ ] 0 pending or skipped tests
- [ ] 80% overall test coverage
- [ ] All tests passing in CI
- [ ] Coverage report visible in PRs
