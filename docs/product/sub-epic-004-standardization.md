## Technical Approach

### Architecture Layers
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Presentation Layer           │
│        (Controllers / Views)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│        Application Services          │
│         (Use Cases / DTOs)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Domain Services              │
│      (Business Logic / Rules)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│          Domain Models               │
│     (Entities / Value Objects)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│       Infrastructure Layer           │
│    (Repositories / External APIs)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Service Pattern Example
```ruby
class ApplicationService
  def self.call(...)
    new(...).call
  end

  def call
    raise NotImplementedError
  end

  private

  def success(data = nil)
    Result.new(success: true, data: data)
  end

  def failure(errors)
    Result.new(success: false, errors: errors)
  end
end
```
