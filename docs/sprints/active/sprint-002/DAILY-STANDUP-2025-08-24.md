# 📅 Daily Standup - STORY-002-002: Backend Model Tests

## 👤 Scrum Master: Angel
**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Sprint Day**: Active Development  
**Story**: STORY-002-002 - Implement Critical Backend Tests

---

## 🨉 Yesterday's Accomplishments

1. **Test Infrastructure Analysis** ✅
   - Analyzed RSpec configuration and test setup
   - Identified testing dependencies (FactoryBot, Shoulda Matchers, SimpleCov)
   - Discovered 90% coverage requirement in spec_helper

2. **Test Failure Investigation** ✅
   - Ran full test suite and identified failure patterns
   - Found 60% of model tests failing due to association mismatches
   - Documented controller namespace issues (3 specs with `uninitialized constant Api`)

3. **Story Model Creation** ✅
   - Generated Portfolio::Story model with migration
   - Added polymorphic user association
   - Created model structure with title, description, status, priority fields

## 📊 Current Metrics
```
Test Coverage: ~15% (Target: 80%)
Model Tests: ~40% passing
Controller Tests: 0% (blocked by namespace issues)
Time Spent: 2 hours
Remaining: ~14-16 hours
```

## 🎯 Today's Plan

**Priority Tasks for Today:**

1. **🔴 Critical**: Run Story model migration and validate
2. **🔴 Critical**: Fix controller namespace issues blocking tests
3. **🟡 High**: Create comprehensive Story model test suite
4. **🟡 High**: Create proper factories for test data
5. **🟢 Normal**: Fix IAM model test failures

## 🚧 Current Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Action Required | Owner |
|---------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Controller namespace errors | Can't run controller tests | Fix Api constant initialization | Dev Team |
| Missing factories | Tests fail with invalid data | Create comprehensive factories | Dev Team |
| RDoc version conflict | Warnings in test output | Update Gemfile dependencies | DevOps |
| Zoxide shell integration | Directory navigation issues | Use alternative commands | Dev Team |

## 💬 Team Discussion Points

1. **Coverage Strategy**
   - Should we prioritize fixing existing tests or writing new ones?
   - Current approach: Fix critical blockers first, then expand coverage

2. **Time Estimation**
   - Original: 16 hours
   - Spent: 2 hours
   - Revised estimate: 18-20 hours total
   - Risk: May exceed sprint capacity

3. **Technical Decisions**
   - Continue with Story model as example implementation?
   - Need to align controller namespace with actual code structure

## 📈 Velocity & Progress

```
Sprint Burndown:
Day 1: 15% coverage achieved (▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░) 
Target: 80% coverage by sprint end
Daily Target: +13% coverage needed per day
```

## 🎯 Focus for Next 24 Hours

**Must Complete:**
- Migration execution for Story model
- Controller namespace fix
- At least one complete model test suite

**Nice to Have:**
- Additional model test fixes
- Factory improvements
- Coverage report generation

## 🤝 Help Needed

- **From DevOps**: Resolve RDoc gem version conflict
- **From Senior Dev**: Review controller namespace architecture
- **From QA**: Validate test patterns and coverage targets

## 📝 Notes for Team

- Test failures are primarily due to model structure mismatches, not code bugs
- Focus on achieving breadth of coverage before depth
- Consider pairing session for complex test fixes
- Document any architectural decisions discovered during testing

## 📋 Updated Task List

1. ✅ Understand current test failures and structure
2. ✅ Create Story model and migration
3. 🔄 Run Story model migration
4. ⏳ Create Story model factory
5. ⏳ Write comprehensive Story model tests
6. ⏳ Fix controller namespace issues
7. ⏳ Fix IAM::Account model test failures
8. ⏳ Fix IAM::User model test failures
9. ⏳ Create factories for IAM models
10. ⏳ Run coverage report and assess progress

**Standup Duration**: 15 minutes  
**Next Standup**: Tomorrow, same time  
**Sprint Review**: When 80% coverage achieved or sprint ends

**Team Confidence Level**: 🟡 Medium  
*We understand the problems and have a clear path forward, but time is tight.*
