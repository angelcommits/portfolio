## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 2-4 hours)
1. Run bundle install to add new gems
2. Test RSpec configuration with example spec
3. Create factories for core models
4. Write initial model specs
5. Setup Jest for frontend

### Short-term Goals (Next 1-2 days)
1. Complete backend test coverage to 80%
2. Setup frontend testing infrastructure
3. Implement E2E tests for critical paths
4. Verify CI pipeline works end-to-end

## 🚧 Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- Need to run `bundle install` for new gems
- Database connection for tests needs verification
- Frontend test setup not started

### Risks
- Existing tests may have many failures
- Test database configuration may need adjustment
- CI pipeline needs secrets configuration in GitHub
